    "The goal of this project is to perform comprehensive sentiment analysis and text classification on Steam game reviews to gain valuable insights into user sentiments and preferences. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the project aims to achieve the following objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Sentiment Analysis__: Analyze the sentiment expressed in Steam game reviews using both rule-based methods (VADER sentiment analysis) and machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Text Classification__: Build and evaluate a text classification model to categorize reviews into positive and negative sentiments based on user votes (upvotes or downvotes).\n",
    "\n",
    "__User Behavior Exploration__: Utilize additional information such as playtime, number of games owned, and number of reviews written by users.\n",
    "\n",
    "By achieving these objectives, the project aims to provide game developers, platform administrators, and gamers with actionable insights to enhance user experiences, understand popular game trends, and potentially improve game recommendations on the Steam platform."

    "__Accuracy (0.8)__: This indicates that the Naive Bayes classifier correctly predicted the sentiment (True or False) 80% of the time on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Precision__: Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. In our case, precision for the 'True' class is 0.78, which means that when the model predicts a positive sentiment, it is correct about 78% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Recall__: Recall, or sensitivity, is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in actual class. For the 'True' class, recall is 1.00, indicating that the model is capturing all the positive instances in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "__F1-score__: The F1-score is the weighted average of precision and recall. It's a useful metric when dealing with imbalanced classes. For the 'True' class, the F1-score is 0.88, which is a strong balance between precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Support__: The number of actual occurrences of the class in the specified dataset. It can help to understand how well thr model performs on each class.\n",
